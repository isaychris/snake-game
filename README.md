# snake-game
The classic snake game where the user must control a snaking using WASD and eat apples to score points. 
The user loses when the snake head touches the snakes body. The snake is implemented through the use of a linked list.

This was created to test out game programming patterns. 

The only difference between ```original``` and ```split``` is how the code is organized.
